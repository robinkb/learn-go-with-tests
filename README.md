# Learn Go with tests

This repository contains the code that I wrote while going through a book named [Learn Go with tests][0].
As the name implies, the book teaches you Go using [Test-Driven Development][1].

This project uses [Mage][2] for task automation.
Some of the code in this project's Magefile is a bit on the experimental side.
